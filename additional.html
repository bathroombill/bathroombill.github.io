            <h4>Section 1: Real Moral Situation</h4>
                <p class="c11"><span class="c5">In North Carolina, the government passed a bill which mandated that a person use the bathroom of the gender assigned to them on their birth certificate. This kept people from using public restrooms in some cases because they felt uncomfortable using the bathroom because of the prejudice of some people and the perceived (and in some cases real) hate coming their way. This bill was passed on March 26, 2016 by the North Carolina governor. This was able to occur because it is a logical law and kept confusion from occuring.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c6">The current laws were somewhat ambiguous on this topic, but government decisions such as a guidance produced by the Department of Justice and the Department of Education which allowed for students to use the identified gender at school and a Supreme Court ruling that said a student must use his born gender&rsquo;s bathroom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c5">0.3% of people in the US are transgender</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c5">51% of Americans think such laws (regarding transgenders) are necessary</span></p><p class="c9"><p class="c11"><span class="c6">This is connected to the issue because people desire to use the bathroom of the gender which they identify with, but certain laws try to prohibit that. This brings up the idea of whether it is okay to make people go against their feelings and to control their behavior. By restricting bathroom use, it seems to be a wider indication of problems with transgender people.</span></p>
